      >C PROGRAMMING :</a
    >
    <p>
      general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting
      structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a
      static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, C provides
      constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has
      found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language.
      Such applications include operating systems and various application
      software for computers, from supercomputers to embedded systems.

      C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and
      1973 to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to
      re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.During the 1980s,
      C gradually gained popularity. Nowadays, it is one of the most widely used
      programming languages,with C compilers from various vendors available for
      the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C
      has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (see ANSI C) and by the
      International Organization for Standardization.

      >C++ PROGRAMMING</a
    >
    <p>
      C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup
      as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The
      language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has
      object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to
      facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always
      implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
      compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel,
      and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded,
      resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance,
      efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.C++ has also
      been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being
      software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including
      desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL
      servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches
      or space probes).

      >JAVA PROGRAMMING</a
    >
    <p>
      general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented
      (although not a pure object-oriented language, as it contains primitive
      types[unreliable source?]), and designed to have as few implementation
      dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers
      write once, run anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on
      all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.Java
      applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
      virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
      The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level
      facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most
      popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for
      client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
    </p>

      Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which
      has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core
      component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference
      implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were
      originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in
      compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had
      relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public
      License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of
      these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode
      compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser
      plugin for applets).

      >PYTHON PROGRAMMING :</a
    >
    <p>
      <strong>Python</strong>is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose
      programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in
      1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
      notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
      object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code
      for small and large-scale projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
      programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and
      functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries
      included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
